# CIFAR10_LetsDoThis
Deep Learning Exercise with Book "Deep Learning With Azure", chapter 6.

Jupyter Notebook, not much to say.
To all data scientists: I am a software developer, so I use names like "data" and "labels" instead of "X" and "y".
I am also dumb as a doornail when it comes to the whole topic.

I run it on a GPU-enabled Microsoft Azure VM with Ubuntu 18.04 (Never thought I would ever be writing this sentence).
So I really have no idea what to do to create the needed environment.
